# reviewscraper

This is a web scraper for hotel review data from google reviews and tripadvisor. This project is part of my work as a learning assisstent in UNC for the class COMP 488--Data Science in the Business World. <br>
The instructors of the course: Professor Daniel Ringel and Professor Jack Snoeyink provided me with invaluable help on this project and wrote part of the tutorials.
