# Reviewscraper

This is a web scraper for hotel review data from Google Reviews and Tripadvisor. This project is part of my work as a learning assisstent at UNC-Chapel Hill for the class COMP 488--Data Science in the Business World. <br>
The instructors of the course: Professor [Daniel Ringel](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/directory/daniel-ringel/) and Professor [Jack Snoeyink](https://cs.unc.edu/person/jack-snoeyink/) provided me with invaluable help on this project and wrote part of the tutorials.<br>
Code instructions could be found inside the notebook.
